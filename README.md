# ME490_Codes

This project has two other git repo's associated with it. One of them (ME490) is the design of the PCB that is programmed by this repo and the other (Interactive Design Day Display) is the program for the off board display. To go into more depth on the project, please reference the attached "LAVIS Electronics Subsystem Design" paper for more in depth information.

Arduino and C++ codes for the AR_20 PCB

Notes to tune this project:
1) Make sure to have Atmel Studio installed
2) This project requires an Atmel Ice to program the chip
3) When connecting, the indicator nub faces inwards towards the ATMEGA328P chip

How to edit the code:
1) Open the project file in atmel studio to edit the code
2) Open "Test_Bed.cpp". This is the main program that controls the project
